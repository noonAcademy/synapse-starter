  Interview the builder to fill SPEC.md before any building starts: what the app is, who
  uses it, where every displayed number comes from, what events it publishes. Use whenever a
  build starts fresh ("build me...", "I want an app/dashboard that..."), whenever SPEC.md
  still says "status: not yet filled in", and before any first feature of a new app.

# Plan first — fill SPEC.md before building

`SPEC.md` (repo root) is this app's memory: agents read it at the start of every session, and
it's the contract for what gets built. This skill fills it in by **interviewing the builder**,
then gets their approval, and only then hands off to building.

> **HARD RULE: never start coding while `SPEC.md` says `status: not yet filled in`.** No pages,
> no reads, no events, no "quick prototype first". The interview is the first deliverable.

## How to interview

- **One question at a time.** Ask, wait, then ask the next. Never a wall of questions.
- **Plain, non-technical language.** The builder is a teacher or an ops person, not an engineer.
  Ask "which numbers do you check every morning?", not "what dimensions do you want to slice by?".
- **Push back on UI-first asks.** "A dashboard" is not an answer — reply with: *which* numbers,
  from *where*, calculated *how*? A chart with no defined source number is not spec'd yet.
- **"Everything" is not scope.** When the answer is broad, ask what they'd keep if they could
  only have three numbers. Move the rest to Out of scope.

Work through the SPEC sections in order — each one is roughly one or two questions:

1. **What this app does** — "Describe the app in two sentences, like you're telling a colleague."
2. **Who uses it and for what** — "Who opens this, and what decision are they trying to make?"
3. **Data** — for every number they want: what it is, and how it's calculated. This is where
   most of the interview happens.
4. **Events** — "What happenings in this app should Noon know about?" (Domain moments, not
   clicks — see the synapse-event-design skill.)
5. **Out of scope** — "What should this app deliberately NOT do?"

## Verify the data exists — before it goes in the spec

Never promise a number the warehouse can't produce. For each number from step 3, check the
data registry ([`server/citadel-schema.ts`](../../../server/citadel-schema.ts), browsable on
the **Get data** tab) — and let the **noon-sql-analyst** skill
([`skill/SKILL.md`](../../../skill/SKILL.md)) confirm the table, columns, and calculation.

- **Exists** → record the row in the Data table: what the user sees → warehouse table → baked
  read name → calculation and caveats.
- **Doesn't exist / can't be derived** → say so now, in the interview, and offer the nearest
  thing that does exist. A spec row is a promise; only make keepable ones.

Remember the app's read constraints while checking: reads are **app-wide** (no per-user
scoping), and rendered data can be up to ~1h behind a ~12h lake refresh. A spec that needs
per-student live data needs redesigning *in the interview*, not at build time.

## Write, approve, then build

1. **Write `SPEC.md`** — fill every section; keep the table shapes the template ships with.
   Add the first Decisions-log line: `YYYY-MM-DD — initial spec agreed`.
2. **Show it to the builder and ask for approval** in plain terms: "This is what I'll build —
   did I get it right?" Fold in corrections and ask again.
3. **On approval, flip the top line** to `status: approved YYYY-MM-DD`. Only now does building
   start — usually via the **synapse-add-page** skill, one Data-table row at a time.

## Keeping SPEC.md alive

After any substantive change (new page, new read, new event, changed calculation, descoped
feature): append a dated one-liner to the Decisions log and update the affected sections.
A stale spec is worse than an empty one — the next session trusts what it reads here.
